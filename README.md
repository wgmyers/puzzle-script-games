PuzzleScript Games
==================

Some games written in [PuzzleScript](https://github.com/increpare/PuzzleScript).

Run At Sign Run
---------------

A simple game involving running about and not dying. See 'run' directory.

The Pontoluvian StraightJacket Puzzle
-------------------------------------

A puzzle I first wrote in 1984 on the ZX Spectrum, now reincarnated. See 'psp' directory.

This PuzzleScript version didn't work until Rory O'Kane dived in and fixed the code. His stuff is here: https://github.com/roryokane

Memories Of Castlemouse
-----------------------

See the 'ac' directory.

This started as a failed attempt to demake Castlemouse, which I haven't played in years, owing to issues getting Shockwave working under Wine. You can track down Castlemouse here: http://jayisgames.com/archives/2010/02/castlemouse.php

I sort of went somewhere else with it. See what you think: http://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=6976592

Snakeoban
---------

Everyone playing with PuzzleScript must write a Sokoban variant. This is mine.
