The Pontoluvian StraightJacket Puzzle
-------------------------------------

A puzzle I first wrote in 1984 on the ZX Spectrum, now reincarnated. See 'psp' directory.

This PuzzleScript version didn't work until Rory O'Kane dived in and fixed the code. His stuff is here: https://github.com/roryokane

Animal Cascade
--------------

See the 'ac' directory.

This is a failed attempt to demake Castlemouse, which I haven't played in years, owing to issues getting Shockwave working under Wine.

As much as I could remember of how it went, ten years after the last time I played it, here: http://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=6928253
